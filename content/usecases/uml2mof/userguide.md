# Using a UML modeler to generate metamodels - User Guide

> **By Freddy Allilaire (INRIA), RÃ©mi Schnekenburger (CEA LIST)** \
> May 2007

This user guide explains how to configure and launch the Using a UML modeler to generate metamodels ATL service in Papyrus.

## User Guide

First step is to create a new transformation configuration, using the Run As button.

Thanks to the pop-up menu available on Papyrus transformation, you can create a new transformation configuration. This transformation configuration will contain all necessary parameters for your transformation.

Thanks to the **Browse...** button in the Module group, the transformation module can be selected against all transformation modules available for Papyrus. In this use case, please select the **UML to Ecore** module or **UML to KM3** module .

The next step is to choose the uml file on which the transformation will run. The following window filters the proposed files using their extensions; you can only select uml files.

The next step is the selection of the target folder. It is not possible to select a project yet. In fact, Papyrus transformations must be run into a folder (yellow folder icons). This should be fixed in next versions of Papyrus tool. The selected folder will contain the results of the transformation.

The following snapshot gives an example of what you should have just before launching the transformation. The transformation is launched using the **Run** button.

With this example, this transformation outputs **Book.ecore** or **Book.km3** (according to the selected module).
