# ATL Use Cases

This section provides a set of ATL model transformation use cases covering different domains of application. These use cases are concrete examples of how model to model transformation (M2M) can be applied. Some of these use cases will be simple ones, some others will be more elaborated and will reuse basic use cases or parts of other ones.

A general description is given for each of these use cases, as well as some more precise documentations. For many of them, prototypes have already been implemented and are directly downloadable from this website.1

The general status of each of the provided use cases is indicated by one of the following icon:

## List of use cases

{{< grid/div class="col-md-6" >}}
### [DSLs coordination for Telephony](dslstelephony/)
{{</ grid/div >}}
{{< grid/div class="col-md-12" >}}
This work presents a case study of implementing two telephony languages: SPL and CPL. They are partially based on similar vocabularies. However they are very different and have been designed to be used by different people. The use case shows how M2M transformations may be used to map programs conforming to SPL or CPL at different abstraction levels.

### [Model Adaptation](modeladaptation/)
{{</ grid/div >}}
{{< grid/div class="col-md-12" >}}
The evolution of a metamodel may render its related terminal models invalid. This use case proposes a three-step solution that automatically adapts terminal models to their evolving metamodels. The main contribution is the precise detection of metamodel changes by using the AtlanMod Matching Language (AML), a DSL built on top of ATL and AMW. The running example is the Petrinet models.

### [Models Validation through Petri nets](simplepdl2tina/)
{{</ grid/div >}}
{{< grid/div class="col-md-12" >}}
This work presents a use case of model transformation using ATL rules to validate MDD's models. This use case considers a simplified process description language, SimplePDL. It then presents a property-driven approach in which SimplePDL process models are translated into Petri nets. SimplePDL behavioral properties are expressed on corresponding Petri nets in LTL (Linear Temporal Logic). The Tina toolkit and, in particular, its model-checker, are used to validate process models by checking the expressed properties. This use case has been done by Benoit Combemale ([IRIT](http://www.irit.fr/)). This is a collaboration between [IRIT](http://www.irit.fr/) and [LAAS](http://www.laas.fr/) labs in Toulouse, France.

### [Sharing Rules Between OCL/UML and SWRL/OWL](sharingrulesbetweenocluml_swrlowl/)
{{</ grid/div >}}
{{< grid/div class="col-md-12" >}}
This work presents an implementation of sharing rules between two rule languages from different domains: OCL (Object Constraint Language) together with UML and SWRL (Semantic Web Rule Language) together with OWL. For this integration we used the R2ML (REWERSE I1 Rule Markup Language) metamodel as pivotal metamodel. The R2ML is a general Web rule markup language and it can represent different rule types: integrity, reaction, derivation and production. This work has been done by [Milan MilanoviÄ‡](https://milan.milanovic.org/) in collaboration between the GOOD OLD AI Laboratory at University of Belgrade, [School of Interactive Arts and Technology](https://www.sfu.ca/siat) at [Simon Fraser University Surrey](https://www.surrey.sfu.ca/) in Canada and Chair of Internet Technology at Brandenburg University of Technology at Cottbus in Germany.

### [Compiling a new formal verification language to LOTOS (ISO 8807)](fiacre2lotos/)
{{</ grid/div >}}
{{< grid/div class="col-md-12" >}}
In this use case, we translate [FIACRE](https://www-sop.inria.fr/oasis/fiacre/) programs into LOTOS ([ISO 8807](https://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=16258)) programs, which can then be verified using the [CADP](http://www.inrialpes.fr/vasy/cadp/) toolbox. This work is the result of the cooperation of two INRIA teams: ATLAS (Nantes), and [VASY](http://www.inrialpes.fr/vasy/) (Grenoble), in the context of the [OpenEmbeDD](https://openembedd.inria.fr/) project.

### [Models Measurement](modelsmeasurement/)
{{</ grid/div >}}
{{< grid/div class="col-md-12" >}}
This use case shows how to compute and generate measures on KM3 metamodels or UML2 models, and how to display them in different way (HTML, and SVG). This work has been done in collaboration between SODIUS and the ATLAS Group. As a complementary application to this contribution, an online service is provided at SODIUS's web site under the name "MC-Meter".

### [Modeling Web applications](webapp.modeling/)
{{</ grid/div >}}
{{< grid/div class="col-md-12" >}}
This use case shows how model weaving is used to help in the development of model transformations. In some cases, the gap between the input and output metamodels makes it difficult to develop a model transformation that works for every input model. In such cases a weaving model can be used to enrich the input model by **annotation**. This process can be thought of as a way to *parameterize* the model transformation.

### [Visual Representation for Code Clone Tools](visualrepcodeclone/)
{{</ grid/div >}}
{{< grid/div class="col-md-12" >}}
The aim of this use case is to realize a uniform visual representation for different code clone detection tools. Different analysis results provided by different code clone detection tools can be injected into models. These models will be transformed to a generic Code Clone DSL model, and then into SVG model. Finally, the SVG code can be automatically extracted from SVG model.

### [Model Driven Performance Engineering: From UML/SPT to AnyLogic](uml2anylogic/)
{{</ grid/div >}}
{{< grid/div class="col-md-12" >}}
This use case presents a transformation from annotated UML activity diagrams to AnyLogic simulation models. The actions and control flows in activity diagrams are annotated with performance information utilizing the UML profile for schedulability, performance, and timing (SPT). This information is used to generate a simulation model that can be executed by the AnyLogic simulation tool from XJ Technologies. Such simulations can help to identify performance issues early in a software design process. This use case has been done by [Jendrik Johannes](https://onepiece.software/) ([TU Dresden](https://tu-dresden.de/)) and its development has been supported by the IST European MODELPLEX project (MODELing solution for comPLEX software systems, FP6-IP 34081).

### [Production of UML class diagrams from syntactical models of english text or SBVR models](syntax2sbvr2uml/)
{{</ grid/div >}}
{{< grid/div class="col-md-12" >}}
This work presents a case study of obtaining a UML class diagram from a syntactical analysis of a text using SBVR as an intermediate layer. We show how it is possible, with the help of model engineering, to realize two transformations: from a syntactical model into a SBVR model, and from a SBVR model into a UML model. This work has been done in collaboration between the ATLANMOD team in Nantes and the ILOG company.

### [QVT to ATL Virtual Machine Compiler](qvt2atlvm/)
{{</ grid/div >}}
{{< grid/div class="col-md-12" >}}
This work provides a QVT compiler that targets the ATL Virtual Machine (ATL VM), and thus provides executability of QVT programs on top of the ATL VM. The code generator is written in the ACG (Atl Code Generation) Domain-Specific Language (DSL). It takes as input a QVT model (typically in XMI format) that may have been created by a QVT front-end (i.e., a parser and type checker) like [Eclipse/modeling/mmt/Procedural QVT](https://eclipse.dev/mmt/?project=qvto#qvto), or SmartQVT. The output of the code generator is a ".asm" file similar to the ones generated by the ATL compiler, or the ACG compiler (both also written in ACG).

### [A Metamodel Independent Approach to Difference Representation](mmindapproachtodiffrep/)
{{</ grid/div >}}
{{< grid/div class="col-md-12" >}}
This work presents an ATL implementation of a metamodel independent approach to the representation of model differences which is agnostic of the calculation method. Given two models being differenced which conform to a metamodel, their difference is conforming to another metamodel derived from the former by an automated transformation. Interestingly, difference models are first-class artifacts which in turn induce other transformations, such that they can be applied to one of the differenced models to automatically obtain the other one. This work has been done by Antonio Cicchetti, Davide Di Ruscio and Alfonso Pierantonio (UniversitÃ  dell'Aquila).

### [Software Quality Control Tools Interoperability (Bugzilla, Mantis, Excel)](softwarequalitycontroltoolsinteroperability/)
{{</ grid/div >}}
{{< grid/div class="col-md-12" >}}
Problems of tools interoperability can be found in various domains. Software quality control is one of these. This use case presents an implementation of bridges between different bug tracking tools like Bugzilla, and Mantis. We also consider that bug tracking information may be handled in a generic tool like Excel.

### [Software Build Tools Interoperability (Make, Ant, Maven)](bridgebetweenbuildtools/)
{{</ grid/div >}}
{{< grid/div class="col-md-12" >}}
Make is one of the most common build tool. It remains widely used but essentially in Unix-based platforms. Many problems have surfaced with scaling Make to work with modern, large software projects. So, it is interesting to provide some bridges from Make to other build tools like Ant (which is popular for Java development and uses an XML file format) and Maven (a Java tool for management project and automated software build).

{{< grid/div class="col-md-12" >}}
This work presents a case study of implementing two business rule languages: Production Rule Representation (PRR) and ILOG Rule Language (IRL). We show how a pivot language can be translated into a concrete one with the help of model engineering. The outcome of this experiment also provides an interesting example of DSLs coordination. This work has been done in collaboration between the ATLAS Group in Nantes and ILOG. A web service PRR to IRL is available here: http://www.sciences.univ-nantes.fr/lina/atl/atldemo/prronline/.
