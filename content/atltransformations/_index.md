## Ant to Maven

  * [Documentation](Ant2Maven/ExampleAnt2Maven[v00.01].pdf), [Source files](Ant2Maven/Ant2Maven.zip)
    > Ant is an open source build tool (a tool dedicated to the assembly of the different pieces of a program) from the Apache Software Foundation. Ant is the most commonly used build tool for Java programs. Maven is another build tool created by the Apache Software Foundation. It is an extension of Ant because ant Tasks can be used in Maven. The difference from Ant is that a project can be reusable. This example describes a transformation from an Ant file to Maven files (project.xml and maven.xml).

## AssertionModification

  * [Documentation](AssertionModification/AssertionModification.pdf), [Source files](AssertionModification/AssertionModification.zip)
    > This example is extract from [Catalogue of Model Transformations by K. Lano](https://nms.kcl.ac.uk/kevin.lano/tcat\(1\).pdf). The purpose of this transformation is to weakening preconditions or strengthening postconditions. This example was extracted by Eric Simon.

## ATL to BindingDebugger

  * [Documentation](ATL2BindingDebugger/README.txt), [Source files](ATL2BindingDebugger/ATL2BindingDebugger.zip)
    > The ATL2BindingDebugger ATL transformation adds a debug instruction to each binding in an ATL transformation.
    >
    > Source and target models conform to ATL metamodel. A sample source model (sample-ATL-0.2.ecore) and its corresponding target model (Sample-ATL-0.2(Debug).ecore) are given.

## ATL to Problem

  * [Documentation](ATL2Problem/ExampleATL2Problem[v00.01].pdf), [Source files](ATL2Problem/ATL2Problem.zip)
    > The ATL to Problem example describes a transformation from an ATL model into a Problem model. The generated Problem model contains the list of non-structural errors (along with additional warnings) that have been detected within the input ATL model. The transformation assumes the input ATL model is structurally correct, as those that have passed a syntactic analysis (for instance, a reference defined with cardinality [1-1] should not be undefined).

## ATL to Tracer

  * [Documentation](ATL2Tracer/README.txt), [Source files](ATL2Tracer/ATL2Tracer.zip)
    > The ATL2Tracer transformation shows how traceability generating code can be relatively easily added to ATL code. It moreover shows that this process can be fully automated.
    >
    > To find more details concerning dealing traceability in ATL, please refer to [1].
    >
    > Source and target models conform to ATL metamodel. A sample source model (sample-ATL-0.2.ecore in ATL2Tracer folder) and its corresponding target model (sample-ATL-0.2-Tracer.ecore in Tracertest/Input) are given.
    >
    > References:
    >   1. Jouault, F : Loosely Coupled Traceability for ATL. In: Proceedings of the European Conference on Model Driven Architecture (ECMDA) workshop on traceability, Nuremberg, Germany.

## BibTeXML to DocBook

  * [Documentation](BibTeXML2DocBook/ExampleBibTeXML2DocBook[v00.01].pdf), [Source files](BibTeXML2DocBook/BibTeXML2DocBook.zip)
    > The BibTeXML to DocBook example describes a transformation of a BibTeXML model to a DocBook composed document. BibTeXML is an XML-based format for the BibTeX bibliographic tool. DocBook, as for it, is an XML-based format for document composition.

## Book to Publication

  * [Documentation](Book2Publication/ExampleBook2Publication[v00.02].pdf), [Source files](Book2Publication/Book2Publication.zip)
    > The Book to Publication example describes a very simple transformation task. In the metamodel Book the class Book contains an ordered set of Chapters. These Chapters hold the information of the number of pages of Chapters. The metamodel Publication is simpler; its class Publication contains a title and the total number of pages. For the transformation, all chapters of a Book have to be visited to calculate the sum of all pages.

## CatalogueModelTransformations

  * [Documentation](CatalogueModelTransformations/CatalogueModelTransformations.pdf), [Source files](CatalogueModelTransformations/CatalogueModelTransformations.zip)
    > All transformations have been extracted from the catalogue of models transformations: http://www.dcs.kcl.ac.uk/staff/kcl/tcat.pdf. From this catalogue, the following ATL transformations have been created:
    >   * Assertion Modification
    >   * Disaggregation
    >   * Eliminate Redundant Inheritance
    >   * Equivalence of attributes and associations
    >   * Introduce Primary Key
    >   * Introducing an interface
    >   * Making partial role total
    >   * Merging Partial Classes
    >   * Raise Supplier Abstraction Level
    >   * Redundant Class Removable
    >   * Removing a Many Many Association
    >   * Removing An Association Class
    >   * Replace association by foreign key
    >   * Replace inheritance by association
    >
    > They were extracted by Eric Simon and Julien Baudry.

## Class to Relational

  * [Documentation](Class2Relational/ExampleClass2Relational[v00.01].pdf), [Source files](Class2Relational/Class2Relational.zip)
    > The Class to Relational example describes the simplified transformation of a class schema model to a relational database model.

## Code Clone Tools to SVG

  * [Documentation](CodeCloneTools2SVG/CodeCloneTools2SVG.pdf), [Source files](CodeCloneTools2SVG/VisualRepCodeClone.zip)
    > This example describes a transformation from the text result generated by code clone detection tools into SVG code in order to realize an uniform representation for different code clone analysis result. At first, specific DSLs for different code clone tools (Simian, simScan, CloneDr) are defined. Then these models can be transformed to a generic DSL for Code Clone. Then, the generic model will be transformed to SVG model. Finally, SVG code can be extracted from the SVG model.

## CPL to SPL

  * [Documentation](CPL2SPL/README.txt), [Source files](CPL2SPL/CPL2SPL.zip)
    > This example handles several aspects of two telephony DSLs: SPL and CPL.

## Disaggregation

  * [Documentation](Disaggregation/Disaggregation.pdf), [Source files](Disaggregation/Disaggregation.zip)
    > This example is extract from [Catalogue of Model Transformations by K. Lano](https://nms.kcl.ac.uk/kevin.lano/tcat\(1\).pdf). The purpose of this example is the following: "A class may become large and unmanageable, with several loosely connected functionalities. It should be split into several classes, such as a master/controller class and helper classes, which have more coherent functionalities and data." This example was extracted by Eric Simon.

## DSL to EMF

  * [Documentation](DSL2EMF/ExampleDSL2EMF[v00.01].pdf), [Source files](DSL2EMF/DSLBridge.zip)
    > This example provides you a complete overview of a transformation chain example between two technical spaces: Microsoft DSL (Domain Specific Languages) Tools and EMF (Eclipse Modeling Framework). The aim of this example is to demonstrate the possibility to exchange models defined under different technologies. In particular, the described bridges demonstrate that it should be possible to define metamodels and models using both Microsoft DSL Tools and Eclipse EMF technologies. The bridge between MS/DSL and EMF spans two levels: the metamodel and model levels. At the level of metamodels, it allows to transform MS/DSL domain models to EMF metamodels. At the level of models, the bridge allows transforming MS/DSL models conforming to domain models to EMF models conforming to EMF metamodels. At both levels, the bridge operates in both directions. A chain of ATL-based transformations is used to implement the bridge at these two levels. The benefit of using such a bridge is the ability to transpose MS/DSL work in EMF platform, and inversely.

## EliminateRedundantInheritance

    > This example is extract from [Catalogue of Model Transformations by K. Lano](https://nms.kcl.ac.uk/kevin.lano/tcat\(1\).pdf). "A redundant inheritance conveys no extra information, but complicates the model. The previous figure shows a typical situation where class A directly inherits from class C, and also indirectly via a more specific class B. The first inheritance is redundant and can be removed. (In some languages, such as Java, such inheritances would actually be invalid)." This example was extracted by Julien Baudry.

## EMF2KM3 (Ecore to KM3)

    >
    > EMF2KM3 is usually used through the KM3 plugin, as the "Extract Ecore metamodel to KM3" action available on *.ecore files. Some users may however want to customize this transformation. Here is the procedure to replace the standard transformation with a custom one:
    >   * modify EMF2KM3.atl to support desired features,
    >   * compile it into EMF2KM3.asm (this is normally automatically performed by the ATL builder),
    >   * copy EMF2KM3.asm into org.atl.eclipse.km3 / src / org / atl / eclipse / km3 / resources,
    >   * restart Eclipse.

## EquivalenceAttributesAssociations

  * [Documentation](EquivalenceAttributesAssociations/EquivalenceAttributesAssociations.pdf), [Source files](EquivalenceAttributesAssociations/EquivalenceAttributesAssociations.zip)
    > This example is extract from [Catalogue of Model Transformations by K. Lano](https://nms.kcl.ac.uk/kevin.lano/tcat\(1\).pdf). Qualified association cannot be represented as attributes, as there is no corresponding attribute notation, i.e., for specifying map data structures. In addition the multiplicity at the owning entity end of an association cannot be generally expressed in the attribute version. For an ordinary attribute this multiplicity is * and for an identity attribute (primary key) it is 0..1. This example was extracted by Julien Baudry.

## Geometrical Transformations

  * [Documentation](GeometricalTransformations/ExampleGeometricalTransformations[v00.02].pdf), [Source files](GeometricalTransformations/Geometry.zip)
    > This document illustrates an advanced ATL program in the area of geometrical transformations. This transformation example describes geometrical transformations. Input of the transformation are geometrical operations (rotate, move, explode) and geometrical data (based on a simplified DXF metamodel). The output of the transformation is the geometrical data (based on the same simplified DXF metamodel) that has been transformed according to the geometrical operations. DXF&#8482;, Drawing eXchange Format, is the native vector file format of Autodesk's AutoCAD CAD application. DXF features include support for 3D objects, curves, text and associative dimensioning. Particularity of the transformations is that it has two input metamodels and that one of the input metamodels is the same as the output metamodel.

    > This example is extract from [Catalogue of Model Transformations by K. Lano](https://nms.kcl.ac.uk/kevin.lano/tcat\(1\).pdf). This reduces the dependencies in the model and enables separate development of A and B, and permits them to be placed in different layers or tiers of the system. This example was extracted by Julien Baudry.

## Java source to Table

  * [Documentation](Java2Table/ExampleJavaSource2Table[v00.01].pdf), [Source files](Java2Table/Java2Table.zip)
    > The JavaSource to Table example describes a transformation from a Java source code to a table which summarizes how many times each method declared in the Java source code is called within the definition of any declared method. A XML-based format, inspired from the JavaML, has been developed to encode all interesting information available in the Java source code. We use, for this transformation, a very basic abstract Table model which may be easily mapped to existing table representations (XHTML, ExcelML, etc.).

## KM3 to ATL Copier

  * [Documentation](KM32ATLCopier/README.txt), [Source files](KM32ATLCopier/KM32ATLCopier.zip)
    > The KM32ATLCopier transformation creates a transformation of copy for a KM3 model. Source model conforms to KM3 metamodel and target model conforms to ATL metamodel. A sample source model (sample-KM3.ecore) and its corresponding target model (ATLCopier.ecore) are given.

## KM3 to ATL conformance checking transformation

  * [Documentation](KM32CONFATL/README.txt), [Source files](KM32CONFATL/KM32CONFATL.zip)
    > This package includes a higher-order transformation (HOT) that, based on a metamodel (i.e., an injected KM3 model), generates a transformation that checks the consistency of two source models that conform to that metamodel. The target model of the (generated) transformation effectively is the union of the two source models with its elements and relations labelled as convergent, divergent, or absent according to their occurrence in one or both of the source models. The HOT provides a means to generically check to conformance of models associated with simple metamodels.

## KM3 to DOT

  * [Documentation](KM32DOT/ExampleKM32DOT[v00.01].pdf), [Source files](KM32DOT/KM32DOT.zip)
    > The KM3 to DOT example describes a transformation from a KM3 metamodel description into a class diagram drawn with DOT. KM3 is a textual concrete syntax to describe metamodels. It has its advantages, yet having a graphical presentation of a metamodel can be sometimes enlightening. DOT is an automatic graph layout program from Graphviz. It can be used to create graphical files, such as PS, PNG... out of its layout. The aim of this transformation is to generate a rough visualization, in the form of a class diagram, of a KM3 model. A metamodel created with KM3 does not include any representation information, so DOT, the Graphviz tool, is used to compute the layout and generate the output picture.

## KM32EMF (KM3 to Ecore)

  * [Documentation](KM32EMF/README.txt), [Source files](KM32EMF/KM32EMF.zip)

## KM3 to Measure

  * [Documentation](KM32Measure/ExampleKM32Measure[v00.02].pdf), [Source files](KM32Measure/KM32Measure.zip)
    > The KM3 to Measure example describes measurement on KM3 metamodels, using metrics defined as ATL libraries. This scenario is an updated version of the scenario KM32Metrics. It is contributed by Eric Vépa ([SODIUS](https://www.sodius.com)).

## KM3 to Metrics

  * [Documentation](KM32Metrics/ExampleKM32Metrics[v00.01].pdf), [Source files](KM32Metrics/KM32Metrics.zip)
    > Due to the even growing complexity of metamodels, the establishment of metamodel metrics now requires the use of dedicated tools. This ATL transformation example aims to show how the ATL language may be used to meet this objective by generating metrics models from metamodels. The Kernel MetaMetaModel (KM3) is a simple textual notation enabling quick definition of metamodels. The KM3 to Metrics ATL example aims to demonstrate the feasibility of computing some metamodel metrics by means of the ATL language. For this purpose, we have developed a basic Metrics metamodel enabling to encode measures of different types. The KM3 to Metrics ATL transformation defines different metamodel metrics that are relative either to the whole model, or to specific model elements. The metrics provided in the scope of this transformation include simple measurements as well as more complex computations.

## KM3 to OWL

  * [Documentation](KM32OWL/README.txt), [Source files](KM32OWL/KM32OWL.zip)
    > This ATL scenario shows up a traduction of KM3 into OWL (Web Ontology language) ontology language. This scenario is composed of one transformation (KM32OWL) and an OWL extractor that produces XML documents conform to the OWL syntax defined by the W3C. Resulting ontology can be used into ontology development tools like Protege (see http://protege.stanford.edu).

## KM3 to Problem

  * [Documentation](KM32Problem/ExampleKM32Problem[v00.01].pdf), [Source files](KM32Problem/KM32Problem.zip)
    > The KM3 to Problem example describes a transformation from a KM3 metamodel into a Problem model. The generated Problem model contains the list of non-structural errors (along with additional warnings) that have been detected within the input KM3 metamodel. The transformation assumes the input KM3 metamodel is structurally correct, as those that have passed a syntactic analysis (for instance, a reference defined with cardinality [1-1] should not be undefined). It may therefore fails when executed on a KM3 metamodel produced from a MOF metamodel that has not been checked.

## KM3 to XML

  * [Documentation](KM32XML/readme.txt), [Source files](KM32XML/KM32XML.zip)
    > The KM3 to XML scenario expresses each metamodel written in KM3 textual syntax with a default XML syntax. As a default syntax, it is not the more concise but it is non-ambiguous and can be apply to any KM3 model.

## KML Injector

  * [Documentation](KMLInjector/ExampleKMLInjector[v00.01].pdf), [Source files](KMLInjector/KMLInjector.zip)

## Make to Ant

  * [Documentation](Make2Ant/ExampleMake2Ant[v00.01].pdf), [Source files](Make2Ant/Make2Ant.zip)
    > Ant is an open source build tool (a tool dedicated to the assembly of the different pieces of a program) from the Apache Software Foundation. Ant is the most commonly used build tool for Java programs. Unlike many other build tools, Ant is independent of both the platform and the development environments. Make (the most common build tool) is based on a particular shell or command interface and is therefore limited to the type of operating systems that use that shell. Ant uses Java classes rather than shell-based commands. Developers use XML to describe the modules in their program build. This example describes a transformation from a Makefile to an Ant file.

## MakePartialRoleTotal

    > This example is extract from [Catalogue of Model Transformations by K. Lano](https://nms.kcl.ac.uk/kevin.lano/tcat\(1\).pdf). Total associations are generally easier to implement and manage than partial associations. This example was extracted by Julien Baudry.

## Maven to Ant

  * [Documentation](Maven2Ant/ExampleMaven2Ant[v00.01].pdf), [Source files](Maven2Ant/Maven2Ant.zip)
    > Ant is an open source build tool (a tool dedicated to the assembly of the different pieces of a program) from the Apache Software Foundation. Ant is the most commonly used build tool for Java programs. Maven is another build tool created by the Apache Software Foundation. It is an extension of Ant because ant Tasks can be used in Maven. The difference from Ant is that a project can be reusable. This document describes a transformation from a Maven files (project.xml and maven.xml) to an Ant file.

## MetaH to ACME

  * [Documentation](METAH2ACME/METAH2ACME.pdf), [Source files](METAH2ACME/METAH2ACME.zip)
    > The MetaH to ACME example describes a transformation from a MetaH format to ACME format. The ACME interchange format was originally conceived as a way to share tool capabilities rovided by a particular ADL with other ADLs, while avoiding the production of many pair wise language translators. The MetaH architectural description language (ADL) and associated toolset support architectural modeling of embedded real-time system applications. MetaH to ACME was produced by Julien Baudry.

## MDL to GMF

    > The ModelsMeasurement project is used to collect measurement data on KM3 metamodels or UML2 models, using libraries implementing some metrics (MOOD, MOOD2, MOOSE, EMOOSE and QMOOD). The measure level can be changed by setting an other value for the first helper measureLevel of the transformation KM32Measure or UML22Measure. This scenario is contributed by Eric Vépa ([SODIUS](https://www.sodius.com)).

## MOF to UML

  * [Documentation](MOF2UML/ExampleMOF2UML[v00.01].pdf), [Source files](MOF2UML/UML2MOF.zip)
    > The MOF (Meta Object Facility) is an OMG standard enabling to describe metamodels through common semantics. The UML (Unified Modelling Language) Core standard is the OMG common modelling language. Although, the MOF is primarily designed for metamodel definitions and UML Core for the design of models, the two standards handle very close notions. This example describes a transformation enabling to pass from the MOF to the UML semantics. The transformation is based on the UML Profile for MOF OMG specification.

## Monitor to Semaphore

  * [Documentation](Monitor2Semaphore/ExampleMonitor2Semaphore[v00.01].pdf), [Source files](Monitor2Semaphore/Monitor2Semaphore.zip)
    > The Monitor to Semaphore example describes a transformation from a program containing Hoares monitors definitions into an equivalent program in which synchronization operations are based on Dijkstras semaphores. This is an example of end-to-end transformation, from code to code. It strictly follows the operational semantic of monitors described in terms of semaphores and shows how this abstract description may be implemented into an executable ATL transformation.

## Microsoft Office Excel Extractor

  * [Documentation](MSOfficeExcelExtractor/ExampleMicrosoftOfficeExcelExtractor[v00.01].pdf), [Source files](MSOfficeExcelExtractor/MicrosoftOfficeExcelExtractor.zip)
    > The Microsoft Office Excel extractor's example describes a transformation from an Excel model to an Excel workbook. The transformation is based on a simplified subset of the SpreadsheetML XML dialect which is the one used by Microsoft to import/export Excel workbook's data in XML since the 2003 version of Microsoft Office. This transformation produces an Excel XML file which can be directly opened by Microsoft Excel 2003. This file describes a workbook with the same content that the one of the input Excel model.

## Microsoft Office Excel Injector

  * [Documentation](MSOfficeExcelInjector/ExampleMicrosoftOfficeExcelInjector[v00.01].pdf), [Source files](MSOfficeExcelInjector/MicrosoftOfficeExcelInjector.zip)

    > The "Microsoft Office Excel to Software Quality Control" example describes a transformation from an Excel workbook containing information about quality controls of a software product to a model storing the same data in a more general and abstract structure. The transformation is based on a simplified subset of the SpreadsheetML XML dialect which is the one used by Microsoft to import/export Excel workbook's data in XML since the 2003 version of Microsoft Office. It is also based on a Software Quality Control metamodel which describes a simple structure to manage software quality controls (for example bug-tracking). The input of the transformation is an Excel XML file, containing the description of the Excel workbook, which can be directly opened by Excel 2003. The output is a model which conforms to the SoftwareQualityControl metamodel.

## MySQL to KM3

    > The OCL to R2ML transformation scenario describes a transformation from OCL (Object Constraint Language) metamodel (with EMOF metamodel) into a R2ML (REWERSE I1 Rule Markup Language) metamodel. The Object Constraint Language (OCL) is a language that enables one to describe expressions and constraints on object-oriented (UML and MOF) models and other object modeling artifacts. An expression is an indication or specification of a value. A constraint is a restriction on one or more values of (part of) an object-oriented model or system. REWERSE I1 Rule Markup Language (R2ML) is a general web rule markup language, that can represent different rule types: integrity, reaction, derivation and production. It is used as pivotal metamodel to enable sharing rules between different rule languages, in this case with the OCL.

## Public to Private

  * [Documentation](Public2Private/README.txt), [Source files](Public2Private/Public2Private.zip)
    > The Public2Private ATL transformation makes all public attributes of a UML 1.4 model private. Getters and setters are also created appropriately (i.e. no setter for a frozen attribute). This transformation uses ATL refining mode as defined in [1]. Thanks to refining mode, only two rules have to be written: one for read-only (i.e. "frozen" in UML terminology) attributes and one for read-write attributes.
    >
    > Source and target models conform to UML the 1.4 metamodel provided as UMLDI.xmi. A sample source model (PetriNet.xmi) and its corresponding target model (PetriNet-Privatized.xmi) are given. Both models are also given in PNG format for easy visualization: [PetriNet.png](Public2Private/PetriNet.png) and [PetriNet-Privatized.png](Public2Private/PetriNet-Privatized.png).

    > The R2ML to SWRL transformation scenario describes a transformation from R2ML (REWERSE I1 Markup Language) metamodel into a SWRL (Semantic Web Rule Language) metamodel (RDM). SWRL is a web rule language based on combination of the OWL DL and OWL Lite sublanguages of the OWL Web Ontology Language, with the Unary/Binary Datalog RuleML sublanguages of the Rule Markup Language (RuleML). REWERSE I1 Rule Markup Language is a general web rule markup language, that can represent different rule types: integrity, reaction, derivation and production. It is used as pivotal metamodel to enable sharing rules between different rule languages, in this case with the SWRL.

## Syntax to SBVR to UML

  * [Documentation](../usecases/syntax2sbvr2uml/), [Source files](Syntax2SBVR2UML/Syntax2SBVR2UML.zip)
    > These transformations are used to produce a UML class diagram from controlled English text using SBVR and Syntax as intermediate layers. Syntax is an original metamodel allowing to describe syntactical, grammatical and semantical properties of an english text. SBVR is a metamodel, obtained from the OMG's specification, for describing semantics of business vocabularies and facts. UML class diagrams allow to express concepts, relations and instances (a conceptual schema). The aim of this scenario is to allow the automatic production of a SBVR model from a syntactical analysis of an english text, then produce a corresponding UML model. The linguistic analysis itself, which may automatically produce a Syntax model from plain text, is outside the scope of this scenario.

## UML CopyModel, ModelCopy

  * [Documentation](UMLRefinementTransformations/MDE%20Case%20Studies%20[SOFT].pdf), [Source files](https://github.com/dwagelaar/UML1CaseStudies)
    > These transformations are part of the UML refinement transformations by Dennis Wagelaar.
    >
    > Introduction: "UML allows for the introduction of custom abstractions using stereotypes and/or profiles. These abstractions can be refined to a lower-level UML description using refinement transformations. Several refinement transformations are provided to refine such abstractions as 'Observer', 'Singleton' and 'Applet'. Refinement transformations are also provided to refine standard UML elements into lower-level structures, such as associations to public attributes and public attributes to encapsulated attributes (with getter and setter methods)."
    >
    > The CopyModel transformation copies all elements of one model into another model. There are two variants available:
    >   * **[CopyModel.atl](https://github.com/dwagelaar/UML1CaseStudies/blob/master/uml1cs-transformations/CopyModel.atl):** This version uses ATL refining mode (see the [Public2Private](#public-to-private) transformation and documentation). This means that copying rules are only required for the root model elements. Also, the input and output model are required to have the same meta-model (and repository), since this is required by refinement mode.
    >   * **[ModelCopy.atl](https://github.com/dwagelaar/UML1CaseStudies/blob/master/uml1cs-transformations/ModelCopy.atl):** Another version based on auto-generated, explicit copying rules for each meta-class. Different (yet compatible) meta-models can be used for input and output model. Also, different repositories can be used, e.g. for copying a model from MDR to EMF.

    >
    > These transformations are meant to merge a model with the main model. The MERGE model is merged with the IN model and written to the OUT model. They are currently limited to copying elements that can occur in UML Class Diagrams (including Action Semantics). There are two variants available:
    >   * **[MergeModel.atl](https://github.com/dwagelaar/UML1CaseStudies/blob/master/uml1cs-transformations/MergeModel.atl):** Based on refinement mode. This means that all models are required to have the same meta-model (and repository), since this is required by refinement mode. Partly optimised for speed by caching intermediate results in OCL helper attributes.
    >   * **[ModelMerge.atl](https://github.com/dwagelaar/UML1CaseStudies/blob/master/uml1cs-transformations/ModelMerge.atl):** Based on auto-generated, explicit copying rules for each meta-class. Different (yet compatible) meta-models (and repositories) can be used for the models. NOTE: This transformation is no longer maintained/used because it is too complex/inefficient compared to its alternative.

    >
    > These transformations introduce the Java infrastructure to implement the "Observer", "Observable" and "subscribe" Stereotypes. Any instances of "Observer" Classes that have a "subscribe" Association to an "Observable" Class, will automatically be subscribed to the "Observable" instance that they are linked to. In addition, all setter Methods of the "Observable" Class will be updated to do a notify as well. An "update" Operation/Method will be introduced for each "Observer" Class, which is configured to invoke any "onXYZChange" Operations, where "XYZ" is the name of the Attribute that is changed. There are two variants available:
    >   * **[Observer.atl](https://github.com/dwagelaar/UML1CaseStudies/blob/master/uml1cs-transformations/Observer.atl):** Uses strict Java 1 API. Works on J2ME MIDP 1.0 as well.
    >   * **[JavaObserver.atl](https://github.com/dwagelaar/UML1CaseStudies/blob/master/uml1cs-transformations/JavaObserver.atl):** Uses the java.util.Observer framework.
